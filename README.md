# profit-margin-inflation-indonesia
The codes are based on the research about the share of profit margin behavior in affecting the inflation rate in Indonesia. The inflation rate in this context is based on the gross value add inflation rate. We exploit the "Industri Besar Sedang" survey from BPS. Unfortunately, the data are not free, so we can't share the data in this page.
